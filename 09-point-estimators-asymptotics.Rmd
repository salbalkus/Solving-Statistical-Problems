# Point Estimators: Asymptotics {#point-estimators-asymptotics}

Evaluating the asymptotic properties of point estimators.

## Consistency

An important asymptotic property of an estimator is that it converges in probability to the true value being estimated as $n \rightarrow \infty$. This is called **consistency**. 

One strategy for proving consistency is to use the Weak Law of Large Numbers.

**iid version**: If $Z_i$ are iid with finite mean, then

$$\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\overset{\mathcal{p}}{\rightarrow}E(X_i)$$

**Non-iid version**: Alternatively, we can drop the iid assumption; if $X_i$ have finite mean and variance, $Cov(X_i, X_j) = 0$, and $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\sigma_i^2}{n^2} = 0$, then

$$\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nE(X_i) \overset{\mathcal{p}}{\rightarrow} 0$$

The WLLN can be combined with the Continuous Mapping Theorem to show a variety of estimators are consistent.
