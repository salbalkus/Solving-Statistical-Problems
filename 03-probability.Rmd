# Probability {#probability}

This chapter is about how to manipulate probability functions directly

## Conditional Probability

:::{.definition name="Conditional Probability"}
The probability of event $A$ occurring given that we know event $B$ has occurred is given by

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$$

:::

:::{.definition name="Bayes' Theorem"}

If we need to invert the order of $A$ and $B$ in a conditional probability express, we can use the property

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$
:::

## Independence {#independence}

:::{.definition name="Independence"}
Two events are **statistically independent** if the occurrence of one has no impact on the other. Mathematically,

$$P(A | B) = P(A)$$

By Bayes' Theorem,

$$P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$$
:::

Often, we prefer to use the second definition because it is independent and easier to generalize to multiple events or random variables. For example, if we know that the random variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then

$$f_{X,Y}(x, y) = f_X(x)f_Y(y)$$

This property is the foundation of statistical inference for iid random variables discussed in Chapters 8 and 10.
