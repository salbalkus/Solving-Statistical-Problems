# Introduction

Welcome to "Solving Statistical Problems", a compilation of problem-solving tools and tricks for graduate-level Probability and Statistical Inference courses. 

Many of our examples originate from or are inspired by Casella and Berger's *Statistical Inference*, [The Book of Statistical Proofs](https://statproofbook.github.io/), lectures slides and notes from *BIOSTAT 230: Probability I* and *BIOSTAT 231: Statistical Inference I* at the Harvard Department of Biostatistics, and other online resources. The goal of this site is to provide a supplement to the aforementioned works providing a better explanation of how to actually solve problems using the material presented.
