# Math Tricks {#math-tricks}

This chapter will cover highly specific mathematical techniques used to solve stats problems but themselves require no statistical knowledge, i.e...

- Exponential function as limits/series
- Inductive integration by parts
- substitution tricks for integration
- binomial theorem
- Gamma function properties
- Matrices (determinants, jacobians, etc.)
- Taylor Series (univariate and multivariate)
- Lagrange multipliers? (Maybe save for MLEs)
