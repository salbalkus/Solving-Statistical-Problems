## Table of Sufficient Statistics

Translated from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_family

| Distribution | Parameter | Sufficient Statistic | S.S. Distribution |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Bernoulli | p | $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ | $Binomial(n, p)$ | 
| Binomial | p | $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ | $Binomial(nm, p)$ | 
| Poisson | $\lambda$ | $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ | $Poisson(n\lambda)$ | 
| Negative Binomial | p | $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ | | 
| Exponential | $\lambda$ | $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ | $Gamma(n, \lambda)$ | 
| Normal (known $\sigma^2$) | $\mu$ | $\frac{1}{\sigma}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ | | 
| Normal | $\mu$, $\sigma^2$ | $(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i, \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2)$ | |
| Chi-Squared | $\nu$ | $\sum_{i=1}^n \log(x_i)$ | |
| Pareto (known min $x_m$) | $\alpha$ | $\sum_{i=1}^n \log(x_i)$ | | 
| Gamma | $\alpha, \beta$ | $(\sum_{i=1}^n\log(x_i), \sum_{i=1}^n x_i)$ | | 
| Beta | $\alpha, \beta$ | $(\sum_{i=1}^n\log(x_i), \sum_{i=1}^n\log(1 - x_i))$ |  |
| Weibull (known shape $k$) | $\lambda$ | $\sum_{i=1}^n x^k$ |  |

### A Note on Distributions of Sufficient Statistics

Recall a convenient property of [exponential families](#exponential-family): that their maximum likelihood estimate is a function of their sufficient statistic. Because of this, in order to prove [Finite Sample Properties](#point-estimators-finite-samples) of an estimator or construct [Hypothesis Tests](#hypothesis-tests-finite-samples), it is often useful to understand their distributions. This is why the distributions of each of the sufficient statistics are included in the fourth column of the table above. These distributions are mostly derived from additive, location-scale, and other properties in [Chapter 4 - Known Distributions](#known-distributions)
